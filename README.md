## Bank Of Flatiron
Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial data!

## Description
This is my phase 2 Week 1 code challenge at Moringa School.

This is where I will build out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

## Demo

Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

## Tools used

- vs code

- json server

- GitHub

- Google Chrome.

- Git

## Setup/Installation requirements

**To use this repo on your machine follow the steps below**

- Open a terminal/command line interface on your computer

- Clone the repo by using the following:

- git clone:https://github.com/Sharonobinda/Bank-of-Flatiron.git

- Change directory to the repo folder;

  cd Phase-1-Flatagram-Code-Challenge

- To Open the repo in Visual Studio Code: code .

****Use the following steps to run the application;**

- First, make sure that you have 'json-server' installed globally or locally in your project.

- In this project, you will install it globally by navigating to your project directory and run the following command on your vs code terminal;

    npm install -g json-server

- Also, ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed and that they are up to date
  
**Then follow the instructions below for live server to work well with json-server​****

- Run the following command to get server started:
   ​npx json-server --watch db.json 
- Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
   http://localhost:3000/transactions/
- In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `8000`.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See a table of the transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new
  transaction to the table **as well as post the new transaction to the backend
  API for persistence**.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a
  description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions
  table.

## Advanced Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table and delete it from the backend.
